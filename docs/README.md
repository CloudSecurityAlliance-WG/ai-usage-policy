# Cloud Security Alliance AI Usage Policy

The Cloud Security Alliance AI Usage Policy website provides tools, guidelines and best practices for 
organizations using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning both in the cloud and on premises. 
The website aims to help organizations ensure that their AI systems are secure, ethical, and aligned with 
industry standards and regulations. The site provides information on key areas such as data privacy, 
security, and governance, as well as practical recommendations for deploying AI systems in a secure and 
responsible manner.
